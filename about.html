				<p>
					Growing up I had a lot sadness and shame surrounding having the psychosexual issue vaginismus 
					which leads to pain during intercourse. So I looked for ways to compensate.
				</p>
				<p>
					I became the editor of the sadly now defunct fetish magazine Forum. Following this, I set up a women's 
					support group at Sh! Women's Store called Fannying Around. While the name may seem irreverent, 
					the group attracted many people who would not usually seek out a therapist but needed a safe space where 
					they could discuss feeling and thoughts surrounding their bodies and sex lives.
				</p>
				<p>
					While I struggled to find help from therapists, at work I learnt a huge amount about myself and other people 
					and finally trained to be the therapist I wished I had.
				</p>
				<p>
					I now specialise in sexual pain and arousal issues as well as difficulties surrounding kink and fetish, gender 
					identity and opening up relationships. I am also qualified and experienced at working with sexual compulsivity 
					and sex offending.
				</p>
				<p>
					It's a huge honour to help other people through their issues to live the fulfilling life that they deserve.
